# Epidemiology AI - Presentation Outline

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Epidemiology AI: Disease Outbreak Early Warning System**
_AI-powered solution for early disease outbreak detection_

- Team Name
- Date: January 10, 2025
- Hackathon Name

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Traditional Surveillance is Too Slow**

- By the time outbreaks are confirmed, disease has already spread
- In dense populations, delayed response leads to large-scale outbreaks
- Critical need for early detection systems
- Current methods rely on confirmed case reports which are inherently delayed

## Slide 3: Our Solution

**AI-Powered Early Warning System**

- Analyzes multiple real-time data streams
- Predicts outbreaks 2-4 weeks earlier than traditional methods
- Combines epidemiological, climate, social, and environmental data
- Provides actionable insights to public health officials

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Multi-Source Data Integration**

- Epidemiological data (case reports, hospital admissions)
- Climate data (temperature, rainfall, humidity)
- Social indicators (search trends, social media mentions)
- Environmental factors (vector breeding conditions)
- Machine learning models process all data for predictions

## Slide 5: Key Features

**Comprehensive Outbreak Detection**

- Real-time prediction engine
- Interactive dashboard with geospatial mapping
- Automated risk-based alerts
- Multi-disease support (dengue, COVID-19, influenza)
- Trend analysis and reporting

## Slide 6: Technology Stack

**Modern Tech for Scalable Solution**

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with D3.js visualization
- Database: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB for time-series
- ML: Time-series forecasting, anomaly detection
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes

## Slide 7: Innovation & Impact
